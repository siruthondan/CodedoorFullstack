## Setup with Docker
We will use Docker to run your project for the Coding Challenge.
1. [Install Docker and Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Clone the Git repository
First you will need to clone the Git repository

### Run Project in Docker Container
Now, navigate to the folder with your files.   
You need to run the application:
```bash
docker-compose up
```
This will build a Docker Image and then start the service.  

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to see the project.
