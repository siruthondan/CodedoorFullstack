## Setup for a Vagrant-Based Environment

A Vagrant-based environment is the preferred way to replicate the coding challenge environment on your system. It is relatively easy to install, especially when compared with installing all the different software components one-by-one, directly on your System.

To get started, go ahead and install these tools:
1. [Virtualbox](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
2. [Vagrant](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads "VirtualBox") 

## Setup

### Clone the Git repository
First you will need to clone the Git repository


### Start your Project in Vagrant
Now, navigate to the directory with your files.  
You need to run your project with Vagrant:
```bash
vagrant up
```
>**Please note:** The first time you execute the vagrant up command  might take a long time, depending on the speed of your connection to the Internet. It could take tens of minutes, or maybe even an hour.

Open up your favorite browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to see the project.
